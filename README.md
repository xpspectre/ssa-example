# Stochastic simulation algorithm examples

Simple examples of basic Gillepie stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and comparison to continuous ODE model.

The Gardner paper implementation + figs is in `gardner00_bistable_competition.m`.

The degradation experiment that shows different levels of noise depending on system size is in `degradation_ssa.m`.
